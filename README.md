# Handwritten Character Recognition â€“ Machine Learning Project

This project implements a **Handwritten Character Recognition System** using machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for accurate recognition of handwritten English alphabet characters (A-Z). The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten characters and can predict unseen images of characters in real-time.

## **Project Overview**

The primary goal of this project is to create a model capable of recognizing and classifying handwritten characters. We use a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture to process images of handwritten letters and predict the corresponding character.

The system uses OpenCV for image preprocessing and Keras with TensorFlow backend for building and training the deep learning model. The model performs multi-class classification, outputting one of 26 possible characters from A-Z.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Libraries used for building and training the neural network.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image preprocessing such as resizing, thresholding, and binarization.
- **NumPy/Pandas**: Data handling and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and model result plotting.
- **scikit-learn**: For data splitting and preprocessing utilities.
  
## **Dataset**
The project uses the **A-Z Handwritten Alphabets dataset**, which contains 26 different classes of handwritten letters (A-Z). Each letter has multiple images to train the model. The dataset is available in CSV format, where each row represents an image of a letter, and the first column represents the corresponding label.

## **Key Features**
- **Image Preprocessing**: Uses OpenCV to resize, threshold, and normalize the input images for better model performance.
- **Model Architecture**: A **CNN** with multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers to classify characters.
- **Prediction**: The trained model can be used to predict the character from any new handwritten input image.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using accuracy metrics on a test dataset.

## **How it Works**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The images are converted to grayscale, resized to 28x28 pixels, and normalized.
2. **Model Training**: A CNN model is trained on the processed dataset.
3. **Prediction**: After training, the model is used to predict handwritten characters from new images.
4. **User Interface**: The system can be used to recognize characters in real-time from images.


## **Example Use Case**
- You can upload a photo of handwritten characters (like a handwritten letter or a word), and the system will identify and output the correct character or letter.

## **Model Performance**
The trained model achieves an accuracy of **X%** on the test dataset. You can further fine-tune the model to improve its performance using techniques like data augmentation or hyperparameter optimization.

## **Future Improvements**
- **Real-time Handwriting Recognition**: Implementing a webcam-based application for live recognition of characters.
- **Multi-language Support**: Extend the model to recognize more languages and characters (e.g., digits, special symbols).
- **Enhanced Data Augmentation**: Use techniques such as rotation, scaling, and translation to create a more robust model.
